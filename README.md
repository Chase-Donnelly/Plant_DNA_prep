Info for WGS plant DNA extraction protocol

# First make 0.5M EDTA pH 8.0 (or buy premade)
  Weigh out 18.61g of EDTA and add to 100ml duran bottle 
  Add 80ml dH2O to bottle and add stir bar
  Stir while measuring pH 
  Add NaOH drops (~2.2g) until Ph of 8.0 is reached (you can also use diluted NaOH and drip until correct pH) 
  Autoclave for 20min at 15psi to sterilize 
  Can be stored at RT 
  
# Next Create the HB x10 Stock Solution 
  Add: 
    1.21g Trizma Base
    5.96g KCL 
    20 ml EDTA (made above)
    0.255g Spermidine
    0.348g Spermine 
  Into a 100ml Duran Bottle, toping up to 100ml with ddH2O and adjusting pH to 9.0-9.4 with NaOH (this may not be needed as the pH shoud be close to here already)
  Store at 4C in glass bottle for up to 1 year 
  
# Create HB 1 X Solution 
  Take 100ml of 10x HB stock and add to 1L duran bottle (this may be easier to do in a beaker for mixing step)
  add 171.2g of sucrose and 700ml of ddH2O and stir 
  Sucrose may be to thick for stir bar and you may need to stir by hand 
  Once clear, add ddH2O until final volume of 1L 
  Store at 4C in glass bottle for up to 3 months
   
# Make Triton - x- 100 mix
